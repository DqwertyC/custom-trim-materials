# Custom Trim Materials

Live Version: https://dqwertyc.github.io/custom-trim-materials/

This is a simple tool for generating custom trim materials for Minecraft's armor trim system, introduced in version 23w04a.

To generate a trim material, set a name for the trim under the "Trim Name" field. The trim name should be snake_case (i.e. no uppercase, spaces, or special characters). 
Set the item used to create this trim under "Trim Item". The leading namespace identifier is optional.
Use the color pickers on the right to generate the gradient palette. The palette used for the material is previewed under "Trim Palette".

Extra materials can be added by pressing the "+" button, and bottom material can be removed by pressing the "-" button.

Once all the desired materials are set, press the "â‡©" button to download a zip folder containing the resourcepack and datapack for your custom trim material.

Currently for the datapack to work, the '/reload' command is not sufficient, and the world has to be completely exited and rejoined after adding the datapack to the 'datapacks' folder.
